# Springboot_UserManager
Hello there,
Please note!, Before you clone this project you need to create a MySQL with [name..],
After that, Please take a view in the Application.properties in the folder src/main/resources,
change the spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none to spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create,
then the Spring Data JPA will create DB then set it back to spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none,
and also don't forget to change the MySQL schema u create before!!!
Thank for take a step here!
Hope u Understand the Spring Security!
